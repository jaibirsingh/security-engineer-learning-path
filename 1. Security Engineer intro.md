# Core responsibilities
### Asset Management/Asset Inventory
* Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets the organization has.
* They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and
* includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP addresses, physical location, place in the network, applications running on an asset, access permissions (only within the organization or public-facing), and the asset owner details.

### Security Policies
* Sometimes, a need arises for granting exceptions to the security policies due to business needs.
* In such scenarios, the security engineer consults the security principles to allow or deny exceptions and suggest mitigating steps to minimize risks.

### Secure by Design
*  the security posture receives the most Return on Investment (ROI) if it follows a secure-by-design philosophy.
*  This means that the security engineer takes steps to implement a Secure Network Architecture,
*  ensures the organization's Windows, Linux, and Active Directory are hardened, and
*  software development follows the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.

### Security Assessment and Assurance
* To mitigate risks from a continuously evolving threat landscape, a security engineer plans to conduct regular security assessments, audits, and red-teaming and purple-teaming exercises to continuously improve the security posture.
* While security engineers might not be performing assessments and audits themselves, they are primarily involved in helping schedule these activities,
* creating Request for Quotations (RFQs) for external parties to perform these activities, and helping prioritize and implement the findings from them.

# Continuous improvement
The following steps help a security engineer carry out this role.

### Ensuring Awareness
*  Humans are the building blocks of any organization, and as is often said, humans are the weakest link in an organization's security.
*  A security engineer periodically runs awareness sessions targeting primarily social engineering attacks to ensure that humans don't make mistakes that can compromise an organization's security.
*  Awareness sessions are also organized for specific teams to ensure they follow security principles related to their area of expertise, like secure software development or secure network architecture.

### Managing Risks
* Accepting or mitigating risks is often a business decision, and
* a security engineer acts as a trusted advisor of the management.
* Let's take the example of an organization that uses a database software for its supply chain that runs on a vulnerable version of Linux.
* Updating the software, so that it can run on the latest OS version that is not vulnerable, without impacting operations might take significant effort (more than a year).
* It will require engagement with the vendor, who has not yet tested the software on the latest OS version. Deploying the software without testing on the latest OS version will risk causing problems in the organization's operations.
* In such a scenario, the vulnerable OS version poses a security risk.
* A security engineer might suggest mitigating the risk by **hardening the OS through additional controls** and **adding a reverse proxy in front of the vulnerable system** to avoid exposing it to the internet.
* While these steps will not eliminate the risk, they will significantly reduce it without affecting the organization's operations.

### Change Management
*  Let's assume an organization wants to upgrade the e-commerce module of its website for its corporate customers.
*  The new module will require a risk assessment, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment before integrating with the website.

### Vulnerability Management
* The security engineer's job often includes monitoring vulnerabilities across the organization and planning to patch or minimize their risk.

### Compliance and Audits
* Ensuring compliance with regulatory and organizational requirements.
* Depending on the industry, clientele, and location of the organization, it might be subject to various compliance standards such as
* PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001, NIST-800-53, and more.
* A security engineer works closely with both internal and external auditors to detect any non-compliance issues and effectively address them.
* Additionally, they are responsible for upholding the organization's security certifications as needed.

### Disaster Recovery and Crisis Management
* A robust security posture requires organizations to plan for untoward incidents, disasters, or crises.
* A security engineer might be involved in disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management planning as part of the different compliance frameworks and the organization's internal policies.

### Managing Security Tooling
* A security engineer might sometimes be required to configure or fine-tune security tools such as SIEMs, Firewalls, WAFs, EDRs, and more.

### Tabletop Exercises
* Conducted to gauge the operational readiness of an organization from a security point of view.
* Certain scenarios are identified to be exercised, and security team members must explain their respective roles in the scenarios under discussion.
* For example, a scenario might include the compromise of an endpoint device through a phishing email. All the team members will then explain their respective steps per the organization's playbooks.
