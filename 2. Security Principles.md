# CIA
*  When you want to judge the security of a system, you need to think in terms of the security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).

* **Confidentiality** ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
* **Integrity** aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
* **Availability** aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.

Going one more step beyond the CIA security triad, we can think of:

* **Authenticity**: Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source.
* **Nonrepudiation**: Repudiate means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Nonrepudiation ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data. This characteristic is indispensable for various domains, such as shopping, patient diagnosis, and banking.


* In 1998, Donn Parker proposed the Parkerian Hexad, a set of six security elements. They are:

1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Availability
4. Authenticity
5. Utility
6. Possession


We have already covered four of the above six elements. Let's discuss the remaining two elements:

* **Utility**: Utility focuses on the usefulness of the information. For instance, a user might have lost the decryption key to access a laptop with encrypted storage. Although the user still has the laptop with its disk(s) intact, they cannot access them. In other words, although still available, the information is in a form that is not useful, i.e., of no utility.
* **Possession**: This security element requires that we protect the information from unauthorized taking, copying, or controlling. For instance, an adversary might take a backup drive, meaning we lose possession of the information as long as they have the drive. Alternatively, the adversary might succeed in encrypting our data using ransomware; this also leads to the loss of possession of the data.

# DAD
* The security of a system is attacked through one of several means.
* **Disclosure** is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
* **Alteration** is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
* **Destruction/Denial** is the opposite of Availability.
* The opposite of the CIA Triad would be the DAD Triad: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction.

  # Fundamental concepts of security models
* Three foundational security models:

1. Bell-LaPadula Model
2. The Biba Integrity Model
3. The Clark-Wilson Model

Other examples include:

* Brewer and Nash model
* Goguen-Meseguer model
* Sutherland model
* Graham-Denning model
* Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman model

# ISO/IEC 19249
* The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have created the ISO/IEC 19249. In this task, we will brush briefly upon ISO/IEC 19249:2017 Information technology - Security techniques - Catalogue of architectural and design principles for secure products, systems and applications. The purpose is to have a better idea of what international organizations would teach regarding security principles.

**ISO/IEC 19249 lists five architectural principles:**

1. **Domain Separation**: Every set of related components is grouped as a single entity; components can be applications, data, or other resources. Each entity will have its own domain and be assigned a common set of security attributes. For example, consider the x86 processor privilege levels: the operating system kernel can run in ring 0 (the most privileged level). In contrast, user-mode applications can run in ring 3 (the least privileged level). Domain separation is included in the Goguen-Meseguer Model.
2. **Layering**: When a system is structured into many abstract levels or layers, it becomes possible to impose security policies at different levels; moreover, it would be feasible to validate the operation. Let’s consider the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model with its seven layers in networking. Each layer in the OSI model provides specific services to the layer above it. This layering makes it possible to impose security policies and easily validate that the system is working as intended. Another example from the programming world is disk operations; a programmer usually uses the disk read and write functions provided by the chosen high-level programming language. The programming language hides the low-level system calls and presents them as more user-friendly methods. Layering relates to Defence in Depth.
3. **Encapsulation**: In object-oriented programming (OOP), we hide low-level implementations and prevent direct manipulation of the data in an object by providing specific methods for that purpose. For example, if you have a clock object, you would provide a method increment() instead of giving the user direct access to the seconds variable. The aim is to prevent invalid values for your variables. Similarly, in larger systems, you would use (or even design) a proper Application Programming Interface (API) that your application would use to access the database.
4. **Redundancy**: This principle ensures availability and integrity. There are many examples related to redundancy. Consider the case of a hardware server with two built-in power supplies: if one power supply fails, the system continues to function. Consider a RAID 5 configuration with three drives: if one drive fails, data remains available using the remaining two drives. Moreover, if data is improperly changed on one of the disks, it would be detected via the parity, ensuring the data’s integrity.
5. **Virtualization**: With the advent of cloud services, virtualization has become more common and popular. The concept of virtualization is sharing a single set of hardware among multiple operating systems. Virtualization provides sandboxing capabilities that improve security boundaries, secure detonation, and observance of malicious programs.
 
**ISO/IEC 19249 teaches five design principles:**

1. **Least Privilege**: You can also phrase it informally as “need-to basis” or “need-to-know basis” as you answer the question, “who can access what?” The principle of least privilege teaches that you should provide the least amount of permissions for someone to carry out their task and nothing more. For example, if a user needs to be able to view a document, you should give them read rights without write rights.
2. **Attack Surface Minimisation**: Every system has vulnerabilities that an attacker might use to compromise a system. Some vulnerabilities are known, while others are yet to be discovered. These vulnerabilities represent risks that we should aim to minimize. For example, in one of the steps to harden a Linux system, we would disable any service we don’t need.
3. **Centralized Parameter Validation**: Many threats are due to the system receiving input, especially from users. Invalid inputs can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the system, such as denial of service and remote code execution. Therefore, parameter validation is a necessary step to ensure the correct system state. Considering the number of parameters a system handles, the validation of the parameters should be centralized within one library or system.
4. **Centralized General Security Services**: As a security principle, we should aim to centralize all security services. For example, we would create a centralized server for authentication. Of course, you might take proper measures to ensure availability and prevent creating a single point of failure.
5. **Preparing for Error and Exception Handling**: Whenever we build a system, we should take into account that errors and exceptions do and will occur. For instance, in a shopping application, a customer might try to place an order for an out-of-stock item. A database might get overloaded and stop responding to a web application. This principle teaches that the systems should be designed to fail safe; for example, if a firewall crashes, it should block all traffic instead of allowing all traffic. Moreover, we should be careful that error messages don’t leak information that we consider confidential, such as dumping memory content that contains information related to other customers.
